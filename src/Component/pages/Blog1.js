              <h2>
                Overgrown trees and shrubs quickly become an eyesore. Pruning
                shears are essential for keeping branches tidy and under
                control. Multitec provides multiple options to suit both light
                household use and heavy-duty landscape work.

                    effortless snipping of branches up to 15mm thick. At just
                    190mm long, it conveniently fits smaller hands while still
                    providing leverage for tough cuts. The stainless steel blade
                    retains sharpness while the ergonomic CA handle prevents
                    fatigue.

              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg">
                While anvil shears use a flat blade to cut against a plate,
                bypass shears work more like scissors with two curved blades
                passing each other. This makes them extra sharp and suitable for
                detail work like flower trimming. The Multitec Bypass Pruning
                Shear PSB08 brings fine pruning capability to any gardening kit.
                Its 19mm cut capacity handles stems for everything from roses to
                shrubs. At 216mm long, it allows for comfortable extended use.

                enable precision cuts.

                Telescopic Loppers
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg">
                For truly thick branches that laugh at ordinary shears, loppers
                add extra leverage and cutting power. Multitec offers an
                innovative geared design that multiplies force for chopping
                robust wood up to 40mm thick. The Telescopic Geared Bypass
                Lopper BPL37XG combines solid gearing with lightweight
                extendable handles. SK-5 steel blades withstand intense
                pressure, slicing smoothly through tree boughs. Handles extend
                from 25 to 37 inches for increased reach and cutting control.

                Whether maintaining fruit trees, clearing brush, or tackling
                landscape overhaul, these telescopic loppers muscle through
                tasks that leave standard tools struggling. Tough stems meet
                their match.

                From tiny clipping snips up to branch-busting loppers, all
                Multitec tools share sturdy stainless steel construction for

                stainless better resists corrosion and retains integrity after
                years of use. Ergonomic shaping on handles and grips reduce hand
                strain for comfortable operation even during extended yardwork.
                Generous locking mechanisms keep cutting edges safely folded
                away when not in use.
